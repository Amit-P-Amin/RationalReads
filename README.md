# Issues
1.  In both work_index and work_read, many functions duplicated
7.  Increment # of comments on show page when a user submits a comment
8.  Fetch all books once for entire site, instead of multiple times for each collection
9.  Not interested button (to filter recommendations)
10. Not doing bayesian average
13. Comment sort getting called in home page?
14. Am pluralizing comments and ratings, even when there's only 1
15. Avg rating isn't pushing based on size of object
16. Arrow syntax defining routes, get rid of api folder, point from route to controller action
18. If click on search item, shouldn't go to search action
20. Search results should have links as titles
21. In work show page, label average rating
22. In stats row, group together rating stars and average rating, and also make cleared (e.g. two numbers in a row might be confusing)
23. Move autocomplete to server-side, once database gets large
24. Add global function to fetch and give user id / currentUser backbone model
25. Instead of render json: comment on success, user jbuilder
26. Need to add event for onclick, if not in searchbar, clear search items (current only mouseout)
27. Move chapter controller to api namespace
28. Update comment count when leave comment
29. Move chapter show jbuilder to partial
30. For index, fetching entire collection, and then fetching individual pages (double fetching)
31. For my books, does it show all books, or just first 10?
32. Instead of using pre-wrap, convert newlines to p elements, probably using a regex
33. Pagination implemented on all pages?
34. Add alt text to search results (from searchForm, not filterForm)
